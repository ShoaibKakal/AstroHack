# AstroHack
The problem it solves-

As humans we are expanding our boundaries from Earth to space.It took only 63 years when we were flying for the first time in 1903  (wright brothers first flight) and in just 1969 we reached the moon.  Soon there will be flights to moon and NASA is trying to make a complete lunar base on moon by 2030. 
The people on earth can easily connect with each other and also they have no limitation in connecting with the nature. But astronauts sitting in international space station or another spaceships or in future on other planets will not be able to connect with the people or connect with the nature on earth. 
So we are encountering this problem by providing specific sounds from the nature, sounds like of snow, rain, water, Ocean, seas, chattering of birds, forests etc. 
So that the astronauts sitting in the spaceship can listen the sounds and can still feel that they are connected with nature.

We are not limiting our app to just for the use of astronauts it is also for the users who is on the planet earth and wanted to connect with the astronauts present in lower Earth orbit in ISS(ISS had internet connection). Socialize tab will enable users to post threads & photos related to astrophysics and space science.  A profile tab shows users profile and socialize tab will show all the post posted by different people around the world as well as in international space station.

Last but not the least at the home tab we included all the astrophysicist & astronauts biographies that how they impacted the field of space science so that the users can understand that how these people impacted the world with their work in space science.



The following challenges we face while building the our project

1. We struggled in making good UI/UX, because we wanted this app to create imagination in users.
2. We can we connected our app with firebase firestore and authentication for data processing. 
3. Also showing the saved data on Firestore in a recyclerview in Android application was a great challenge.
4. Implementing the music tab with specific sounds and debugging the seekbar and forward & backward play sound buttons.



Who benefits from Astra app?
First of all the astronauts who are living in complete darkness of space with no connectivity to humans and nature.
Secondly the socialize feature of her app enables users on the earth to post related to the astrophysics so that they can increase their human consciousness level. 
At the end the home tab provides the history and biographies of all great astronauts and astrophysicist who created a great impact in the space science which  gives sense higher purpose in their lives.

Why would someone use a app?

"We are pioneers, explorers not caretakers."
Humans are born to explore things and space gives a limitless vision to you means that they can explore as much as they want. If you ask a kid that what fascinates him very much he will definitely say moon stars planets aliens and the whole space. Because it feels creativity and imagination in kids as well as in youngsters. And our app is providing the same.






We are not coming up with a very little innovation in e-commerce or in online education, we are thinking big. Users will be using a social platform which is completely free from those toxic social platforms which give them a poisonous comparison. 

By 2024 NASA is again going to moon with humans and by 2030 NASA will set-up a lunar base on moon where youmans will be living and practicing experiments. Many private space agencies had developed their ow rockets and trying to to send humans for a space to tour. Our aap is trying to challenge the status quo and it is responsible to be being different.
